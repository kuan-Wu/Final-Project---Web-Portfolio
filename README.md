Reflection:

This is my second time having this class. Last time I was failed because some of the property use is not good enough. However, this time I feel I am more confident in using Flex and Grid property. I found out that both of that two properties are actually really useful and convenient to put into a webpage. I used to think they are too hard to code so I always avoid using them. What is more last term I can't even make a webpage in one month every time facing a project relate to coding I will put them in my last homework to do. And after this term, I can finish a simple webpage in only 2 weeks. I feel it is quite amazing and I do feel I have improved this semester. All in all, I want to thank my professor he really make coding become fun stuff to learn. And I will always keep working harder in the future to become a professional web designer.
